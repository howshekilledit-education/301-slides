If you notice anything that stands out to you, reply with a comment! **Make sure you reply to at least on post.** \n\n<br>\nOPTIONAL: See if you can figure out which code created the effect you noticed, and include that code in your post. \n\n# The Syllabus, Highlights\n\n## You can have a one-week extension on ONE of your first two projects. Otherwise, late work is not accepted. \n\n## If average grade is too high, everyone might have their grade reduced. \n\nThe average grade should be around 70% to avoid a downward curve. Please adjust your grade expecations accordingly. \n\n## You should not come to class if you are sick. You should always come to class if you are well and able.\n\n## Participation is an important part of your grade. \n\nThis includes speaking in class, attendance, and in-class activities. \n\n\n## How to Complete Quiz\n\n::: {.column width=\"30%\"}\n\n![](https://brownbagteacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/BubbledScantron-1024x770.png)\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"70%\"}\n\n* Only use the left column\n* Write your first and last name\n* Fill in the correct bubble completely!\n\n:::\n\nYou can reference the syllabus on UR Courses, or I have a few paper copies.\nThis is the **last** quiz where you can reference outside materials. \n\n## p5.js setup() & draw()\n\n```{javascript}\n// <-- Variables you might access throughout your project goe on top. \n// Everything else should go {INSIDE A FUNCTION}\n\nfunction setup(){\n\n    // <-- Instructions in here execute AT THE START\n\n}\n\nfunction draw(){\n\n    // <-- Instructions in here execute next, \n    // either over and over on a loop (default), \n    // or just once (if noLoop() is called)\n\n}\n```\n\n## () {} []\n\nParentheses ()\n\nCurly braces {}\n\nSquare brackets []\n\n^These always come in pairs! Often, they hold important information. If no information is needed, they are empty, but it's still important to include both the open and closing symbols. \n\nCurly braces usually hold instructions for functions, loops, conditional statements etc. \nThese instructions always go AFTER the opening brace { and BEFORE the closing brace }.\n\n## Coordinate Systems\n\n\n![Adrian Piper, *Charted Work Proposal for January â€“ December 1969, 1968*. Typescript and graph paper with space/time coordinate diagrams under sheet protectors in ring binder](https://www.thomaserben.com/wp-content/uploads/API_1968_Charted-Work-Proposal-for-January_1_400.jpg)\n\n## What's on the Quiz vs. What's in Class\n\nSlides and Coding Train tutorials will include the material you need to know for the next quiz.\n\nDemos may preview more advanced material so that you can see what's ahead. These may be covered more explicitly for future quizzes, or may be extra material that you can explore on your own.\n\n# In confusion lies the seeds to understanding! \n\n# Complete Exit Ticket with (x,y) coordinates\n\n",
