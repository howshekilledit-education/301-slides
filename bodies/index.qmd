# Project 1 Self-Assessment Rubrics

---

## Work-in-Progress Shares

Let's take a look at [Forum Response III](https://urcourses.uregina.ca/mod/forum/view.php?id=3102315)

## Modes of Critique 

There are many ways to give and receive feedback, and to evaluate a piece of artwork.


For our Project 1 crits (starting next week), we will use the "cold read" method. You will show your work, and your classmates will respond to it without context or explanation from you. 

## Draft Self-Assessment Rubric in Your Notebook

In URCourses, follow the prompts under In-CLass Exercises > Project 1 | Self-Evaluation Rubric.

You can work on Project 1 after you finish your rubric. 

## Exit Ticket

* In your notebook, write a few sentences about what you learned today, and any questions you have.
* Turn in an image of your notebook page to URCourses > In-class Exercieses > 9/22 Exit Ticket.
