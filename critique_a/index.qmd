# We will begin with a warmup, standing in a circle!
We will do a brief reprise of last week's clapping exercise, in an effort to get focused for crit. 

## Before we begin crit, make sure your OneDrive folder has... {.smaller} 

* [been shared with morgan.harris.green@uregina.ca]{style="color: #ffcc00"}
* [a blank copy of your rubric]{style="color: #ffcc00"}
* [your project 1 .toe file]{style="color: #ffcc00"}
* your polished proposal
* your works cited list 
* your project 1 video recording

[Gold]{style="color: #ffcc00"} items are essential BEFORE crit. 

## Sign up to present! 

* Choose a presentation slot in **URCourses > In-Class Exercises > Project 1 Crit Sign-Up**.
* If you do not sign up, you will be assigned a slot.
* If you are ready to present today, please choose a slot from today if it is available. 
* If you present today, make sure you fill out your self-assessment rubric and add it to your OneDrive by Thursday night! 

## Critique guidelines {.smaller}

* Our goal is to complete half the class today, and half next week.
* Each crit should last about ten minutes, including presentation and feedback.
* For this crit, we will be doing "cold reads," meaning the artist will not give any explanation of their work before feedback.
* You are welcome to ask the artist questions after their presentation.
  * What motivated a decision?
  * What technical choices achieved a particular effect?
* Rather than talking about what is "good" or "bad," focus on what the artist's choices do.
  * For example: this choice effectively evokes this feeling
  * Or: this choice makes me think of this other work
  * Or: this choice makes me curious about this aspect of the work
  * Or: this choice makes me confused about this aspect of the work
* Consider a feedback sandwich: start with an effective aspect of the work, then a suggestion for improvement, then another effective aspect of the work.

# Project 2: Dimensional Data

*Dimensional Data* You will make a project that responds to either
* a data feed from the internet (weather, stock market, social media, etc)
* live posture tracking from a web cam
