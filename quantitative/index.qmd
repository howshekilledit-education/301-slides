# Short Demo


# Project 1 Proposals

---

## Project 1 Requirements {.smaller}

* Use input from your computer's microphone and/or mouse to generate or manipulate visual content in real-time.
* The project should run in TouchDesigner and be presented in Performance Mode.
* You can activate it as a performance, or have it user-activated (e.g. by mouse movement or sound input).
* The project should have a strong conceptual basis and/or be a well-reseearched exploration of a specific aesthetic or visual style

---

## Workshop your proposals {.smaller}

1. Get back into your performance groups. 
2. Each person should take 2-3 minutes to read their proposal for Project 1. Feel free to add additional details beyond what you wrote in your forum post.
3. After each pitch, the rest of the group should provide feedback and suggestions on 
   * Feasibility
   * Process of making
   * Conceptual basis
   * Aesthetic or visual style
4. Feedback should be respectful, but honest. Consider a compliment sandwich: positive feedback, constructive criticism, positive feedback.
5. Write down feedback as you will need to revise your proposal based on the feedback you receive.

---

## Free Writing

Spend five minutes free writing about your project proposal in your notebook (computer closed). 

---

## Revised Proposal

WITHOUT looking at your original proposal (computer closed), write a revised version of your proposal in your notebook. You may look at the notes in your notebook. 

The finished proposal should fill up at least half a notebook page. Take a photo of your notebook page to turn in on URCourses. 

If you don't finish your revision by the end of class, turn it whatever you have in URCourses -> In-class Exercises -> Proposal 1 Revision. 

---

## Exit Ticket

Turn in a photo of your notebook proposal on UR Courses, under **In-class Exercises > Project 1 Proposal Revision**.
