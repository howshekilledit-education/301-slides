<section id="to-purchase" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="to-purchase">To Purchase</h3>
<p>You should purchase the following materials and bring them to every class, starting on the first day of class:</p>
<ul>
<li>A dedicated notebook for this course. Find a notebook in which you can both write and draw.</li>
<li>A pen or pencil</li>
<li><strong>Recommended:</strong> A thumb drive and, if necessary, a USB-C -&gt; A adapter. This will allow you to save your projects from department computers. (Note that it is also a good idea to back up projects to cloud storage!) You can purchase these items in the MAP Art store.</li>
<li><strong>Also helpful:</strong> a three-button mouse will allow you to use TouchDesigner with greater facility. Lab computers include this kind of mouse, but if you plan on working primarily on your personal laptop, you may want to purchase a mouse of your own, <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/AmazonBasics-3-Button-Wired-Quiet-Mouse/dp/B08P6FXKP9?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&amp;ref_=fplfs&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A3DWYIK6Y9EEQB">such as this one</a>.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="software-and-hardware" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="software-and-hardware">Software and Hardware</h3>
<p><strong>This course uses TouchDesigner as its primary software.</strong> TouchDesigner is a node-based visual programming environment, meaning that you can program artworks using a visual user interface, rather than writing text code. TouchDesigner serves a vast variety of art applications, as it accepts all kinds of inputs and produces all kinds of outputs. You can find some examples of the software in action on the community forum <a href="https://derivative.ca/community?sort_by=created&amp;type%5B%5D=25">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The non-commercial version of TouchDesigner is free,</strong> and you can download it onto your personal laptop <a href="https://derivative.ca/product/touchdesigner-non-commercial/77">here</a>. If you plan to use your own computer for this course, make sure that it meets the minimum requirements <a href="https://derivative.ca/UserGuide/Experimental%3ASystem_Requirements">specified by Derivative</a>.</p>
<p>If you prefer to use university computers, laptops will be provided during class, and desktops are available in labs. All of these computers have the necessary software installed. Lab hours will be posted in UR Courses.</p>
<p>TouchDesigner integrates well with a variety of softwares, including Arduino IDE and Unity. You may use the integrations depending on your project’s specific requirements.</p>
<p>In addition, <strong>certain assignments will require additional hardware such as Arduinos or projectors. Materials will be available during class and/or for checkout from MAP</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is your responsibility to save and backup your projects.</strong> If you are using university computers, it is a good idea to backup your projects to both cloud storage and a thumb drive. If you are using a personal computer, you should have a cloud storage or other backup protocol in place.</p>
</section>
<section id="textbooks-and-self-directed-learning" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="textbooks-and-self-directed-learning">Textbooks and Self-directed Learning</h3>
<p>This course has no textbook requirements. <a href="https://derivative.ca/learn">TouchDesigner’s dynamic learning resources</a> act as a living textbook. In addition, the wealth of online documentation of new media artworks act as primary art historical sources for this course. (See the course schedule for some examples.)</p>
<p>While most sessions will include some traditional lectures on how to use TouchDesigner, the majority of class time will take a flipped-learning approach. This means <strong>students are expected to spend time learning TouchDesigner outside of class using provided tutorials and resources.</strong> This frees up class time for students to work with the professor refining their projects and goals. It also creates more time for discussion, group activities and various forms of “play.” Through a self-directed approach, within certain parameters, students can learn those aspects of TouchDesigner most relevant to their interests.</p>

<p>Because the concept of “play” explored in this class includes performance art, we will do some performative exercises that involve movement, vocalization, etc. I invite you to see the classroom as a relatively safe space to take some risks and leave your comfort zone.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="weekly-forum-responses">Weekly Forum Responses</h3>
<p>Each week, you will work with TouchDesigner outside of class and post something about what you have learned. These posts may concern specific projects or open experimentation. Posts might include writing, images from your notebook, screen shots, screen recordings, links to resources, inspirations, etc. The professor will recommend a series of tutorials to guide your exploration. You are welcome to use resources beyond those provided.</p>
<p>Weekly forum responses are credit/no credit, graded for timely completion. Students will be invited to discuss their forum responses during class, and this will also provide time to receive feedback as projects progress.</p>
</section>
<section id="engagement" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="engagement">Engagement</h3>
<p>Your engagement grade is determined by your attendance and participation in class. Good attendance and participation will entail the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Participating in class verbally at least once a week, or equivalent<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
<li>Contributing to most critique sessions</li>
<li>Missing no more than two class sessions</li>

<p><strong>The accommodation for two missed classes – that’s two full weeks of class – is meant to cover most extenuating circumstances.</strong> It is not meant as an addition to classes missed for illness and emergency. As such, you should always attend class when you are well and able.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you miss class for any reason, it is your responsibility to review course materials and share notes with a classmate before contacting the professor with any remaining questions about missed content.</p>
<p>You should not attend class if you have a contagious illness (particularly respiratory illnesses characterized by symptoms like coughing, sneezing, and/or fever). If you have mild symptoms and plan to attend class, wear a mask, or consider staying home.</p>
<p>You should communicate with the professor if you are at risk of missing several sessions due to contagious illness.</p>
</section>
<section id="projects" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="projects">Projects</h3>
<p>This course includes three major projects. Each project will have its own set of technical specifications, and will be graded on technical accomplishment, conceptual rigor, and craft.</p>
<p>For each project, you will create your own rubric, with goals that fit within the assigned project’s specifications. You will use this rubric to self-assess and arrive at a numerical grade. Each project deadline will be followed by two sessions of in-class critique. You should attend critiques ready to receive feedback gracefully, and to respond to questions about your work.</p>
<p>You will complete written reflection and planning modules for each project in your notebook, and log your project progress as you work. This process work is an important part of your assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Your project grade will be determined by your assessment, your professor’s assessment, and your response to questions during crit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You may request to complete one project in a group of up to three students. For group projects, students will each create their own individual rubric for what they have done.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There is no in-person final exam for this course.</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="deadlines" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="deadlines">Deadlines</h3>
<p>You will be permitted ONE of the following allowances for deadlines:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may have a one-week extension on ONE of the first two projects. You must request this extension within 24 hours of the project’s original deadline. You do not need to explain why you are requesting the extension.</li>
<li>You may resubmit ONE of the first two projects within one week of receiving a grade.</li>
</ul>
<p>While you can request additional accommodations for extenuating circumstances, they are unlikely to be granted.</p>
<p>Outside of these accommodations, late work will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Extensions and resubmissions will not be permitted for the final project. Forum responses and in-class assignments are time-sensitive credit/no-credit assignments, and extensions will not be granted.</p>

<section id="academic-integrity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>Academic integrity requires students to be honest and responsible in all learning environments. Academic assignments exist to help students learn; grades exist to show how fully this goal is attained. Therefore, all work and all grades should result from a student’s own understanding and effort. The principles of Academic Integrity include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completing your own work.</li>
<li>Documenting your research and citing the works of others.</li>
<li>Acting ethically and with integrity as you pursue your academic studies.</li>
<li>Upholding the ethical or professional code of the profession for which you are preparing.</li>
<li>Being accountable and taking responsibility for your actions.</li>
<li>Learning from your mistakes.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details about specific acts that may be considered misconduct, please refer to the Undergraduate Calendar Student Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>All breaches of academic integrity will be reported to the Associate Dean (Undergraduate) for investigation, and may result in penalties including a 0 on the assignment or the course, XF in the course, suspension, or expulsion.</p>

<section id="generative-ai" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="generative-ai">Generative AI</h3>
<p>Students are permitted to use generative artificial intelligence and art generation software on assignments for this course only as indicated by the instructor and outlined on UR Courses. Without such permission, students are expected to complete all course work without substantial assistance from others, including automated tools. <em>Students are responsible for documenting their process, including saving drafts of their work, and will need to be able to present that documentation should an academic integrity investigation arise.</em></p>
<p>Always reference sources included in your course work. For guidance on how to reference using various citation styles, please visit: <a href="https://www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/2.html" class="uri">https://www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/2.html</a>. All tools must be acknowledged at the end of the assignment, including grammar assistive technology, in a paragraph that outlines the tools used and what they were used for as well as a history of all prompts used to achieve the results.</p>
<p>You can find the Generative AI policy for each assignment type in the section where it’s posted on UR Courses. Certain assignments may have additional policies in the individual assignment prompt.</p>
<p>Unauthorized or uncited use of generative AI is considered a breach of academic integrity.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Participate in class verbally when you can. The classroom is a relatively safe environment to practice spoken communication, and it becomes easier over time. Your words help create a rich and dynamic classroom environment, and speaking is required for certain activities, such as critique and group work. That said, verbal participation can be difficult and draining. If you feel unable to participate verbally in front of the class, you may also participate by contributing to forums beyond the required specifications, speaking with the professor one-on-one, and/or attending office hours.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<span id="cb1-50"><a href="#cb1-50" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>You should purchase the following materials and bring them to every class, starting on the first day of class:</span>

<span id="cb1-52"><a href="#cb1-52" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">- </span>A dedicated notebook for this course. Find a notebook in which you can both write and draw.</span>

<span id="cb1-54"><a href="#cb1-54" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">- </span>**Recommended:** A thumb drive and, if necessary, a USB-C -&gt; A adapter. This will allow you to save your projects from department computers. (Note that it is also a good idea to back up projects to cloud storage!) You can purchase these items in the MAP Art store.</span>
<span id="cb1-55"><a href="#cb1-55" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">- </span>**Also helpful:** a three-button mouse will allow you to use TouchDesigner with greater facility. Lab computers include this kind of mouse, but if you plan on working primarily on your personal laptop, you may want to purchase a mouse of your own, <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">such as this one</span><span class="co">](https://www.amazon.ca/AmazonBasics-3-Button-Wired-Quiet-Mouse/dp/B08P6FXKP9?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&amp;ref_=fplfs&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A3DWYIK6Y9EEQB)</span>.</span>

<span id="cb1-59"><a href="#cb1-59" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>**This course uses TouchDesigner as its primary software.** TouchDesigner is a node-based visual programming environment, meaning that you can program artworks using a visual user interface, rather than writing text code. TouchDesigner serves a vast variety of art applications, as it accepts all kinds of inputs and produces all kinds of outputs. You can find some examples of the software in action on the community forum <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">here</span><span class="co">](https://derivative.ca/community?sort_by=created&amp;type%5B%5D=25)</span>.</span>

If you plan to use your own computer for this course, make sure that it meets the minimum requirements <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">specified by Derivative</span><span class="co">](https://derivative.ca/UserGuide/Experimental%3ASystem_Requirements)</span>.</span>

<span id="cb1-64"><a href="#cb1-64" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-65"><a href="#cb1-65" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>TouchDesigner integrates well with a variety of softwares, including Arduino IDE and Unity. You may use the integrations depending on your project's specific requirements.</span>

<span id="cb1-67"><a href="#cb1-67" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>In addition, **certain assignments will require additional hardware such as Arduinos or projectors. Materials will be available during class and/or for checkout from MAP**</span>

<span id="cb1-69"><a href="#cb1-69" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>**It is your responsibility to save and backup your projects.** If you are using university computers, it is a good idea to backup your projects to both cloud storage and a thumb drive.

<span id="cb1-75"><a href="#cb1-75" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>While most sessions will include some traditional lectures on how to use TouchDesigner, the majority of class time will take a flipped-learning approach. This means **students are expected to spend time learning TouchDesigner outside of class using provided tutorials and resources.** This frees up class time for students to work with the professor refining their projects and goals. It also creates more time for discussion, group activities and various forms of "play." Through a self-directed approach, within certain parameters, students can learn those aspects of TouchDesigner most relevant to their interests.</span>
