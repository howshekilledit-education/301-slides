## Next class

<br>

Next class, we will have a syllabus quiz (you may reference the syllabus). This will be the *last quiz* where you can look at outside resources. After that, all quizzes will be closed book.

<br>

Make sure you bring a pen or pencil! (Note that you should bring a notebook and pen/pencil to every class.)
