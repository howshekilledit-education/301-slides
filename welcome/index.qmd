## Vocal Sketch with TouchDesigner {.smaller}

1. Get into groups of 3-5
2. Using one person's laptop, download the sound-responsive TouchDesigner project from URCourses.
3. Create a short audiovisual performance, where everyone in your group makes sounds to trigger the image on the screen. 
4. You may also adjust the TouchDesigner project to bettert suit your performance. 
5. We will share our performances at the end of class. Each group will use the projector to perform. 

## Before you begin, discuss:

- What is your performance about? 
- What will it sound like? (Music? Theater? What genre? etc.)

## Exit Ticket

In your notebook, write a brief reflection on something important or memorable from today's class. Show your professor on your way out, and remind them of your name!
